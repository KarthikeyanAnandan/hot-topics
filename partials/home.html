    <p>The time value of money stems from the notion that in the future, reasonable investors prefer to receive money rather than the same amount of money due to the capacity of money to improve value over a given period of time. Money deposited in a savings account, for instance, earns a certain interest rate and is said to be added value.Besides showing the preferences of the rational investor, suppose that you now have the choice to receive $10,000 in two years versus $10,000. Assuming that most individuals would choose the first choice is sensible. Despite the equal value at the time of disbursement, receiving today's $10,000 gives the recipient more value and usefulness than receiving it in the future due to the opportunity costs associated with waiting. If today's money was received and retained in a savings account for two years, such opportunity expense could include the future interest advantage.<br><br>

    <p>Did you ever wonder where food came from? When we think about it, there often comes to mind a image of a farmer planting seeds. But did you understand that before they are planted, some seeds are genetically modified in a laboratory? These seeds are known as GMOs and are transformed into GM foods. Health Canada ensures that it is secure for us to consume all foods, including GM foods. For more information on GMOs and GM foods, read on.<br><br>

    <p>The book tells the power of Visions and invites the reader to participate in the VISIONS 2100 Project by creating and sharing their own vision of life in 2100. The aim is to get widespread engagement and interest in comparing and telling visions of a better future and to drive 'water-cooler' discussions globally.The context of the book is around the challenges presented by climate change and environmental issues, but concept is wider and is about how to change community, and then government, perceptions of how to approach long term global problems. Human psychology is not designed to cope with long-dated problems. We are very good at solving immediate crises but often fail to act on gradual, complex challenges - such as climate change - until catastrophe looms. For environmental problems, the standard approach is to try and get people to worry about the looming disaster but that fails to engage the majority of the population. The telling of visions enables people to engage with and be excited by what is possible - by the opportunities that change can provide.The book balances worries about catastrophe with social and environmental improvements by referencing psychology, management thought, case studies and personal anecdotes. In also references the parallels between the world's journey and coping with the chronic illness of the author's wife."Having a vision of a better world is likely to result in the world being better."The book is framed around eighty short visions by some of the world's leading environmental thinkers and influencers including those leading the process of making global agreements on climate change. The visions are all written from viewpoint of the year 2100 looking back over the last century. They consider what life is like in 2100, the uncertain journey to get there, the fears and hopes for human activities and the benefits of their envisioned worlds. This picture of the future provides an important marker to head towards as we navigate the changes to our society that will occur during the coming century.The narrative weaves the contributions together and provides a coherent picture of how the century will unfold and where we will end up. It ends with a call to action to get readers involved in creating their own future through writing and sharing their own visions for a better world.<br><br>
